# hello-world
So basically this is me getting to know github. Ive been working hard ever since yesterday night with this computer stuff and hoping to learn ALOT by the time school starts. I know I want to get into computer science and I'm happy I've chosen that as my major. 
I'm about to be a junior in highschool and I want to start up my own local tech company
